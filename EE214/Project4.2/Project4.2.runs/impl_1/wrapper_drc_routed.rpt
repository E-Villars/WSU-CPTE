2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ck/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ck/O_reg[0]_i_1/O, cell ck/O_reg[0]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ck/E[1] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ck/Y1_reg_i_1/O, cell ck/Y1_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ck/E[2] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ck/Y2_reg_i_1/O, cell ck/Y2_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ck/E[3] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ck/Y3_reg_i_1/O, cell ck/Y3_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ck/Y0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ck/Y0_reg_i_1/O, cell ck/Y0_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
